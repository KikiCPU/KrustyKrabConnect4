# KrustyKrabConnect4
This is my first 'official' game that I created in computer science class once we were taught the basics of Java. Out of 4 game choices to re-create in class I chose to re-create the game Connect 4 for our final class project. I used the Java software application 'Ready to Program to code. I went with a ‘theme’ for the game and the theme I chose is the ‘Krusty Krab’. I also created all the images and instructions in this game.
