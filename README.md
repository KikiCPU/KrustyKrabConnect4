# KrustyKrabConnect4
This is my first 'official' game that I created when I was taught the basics of Java. I chose to re-create the game Connect 4. I used the Java software application 'Ready to Program' to create this. I went with a theme for the game and the theme I chose is the ‘Krusty Krab’ from Spongebob. I also created/edited all the images and instructions in this game. I've attached the .zip file. The file is too big; it's 20.4MB and GitHub can't show files that are this big at the moment, so you can just download it and go from there.
